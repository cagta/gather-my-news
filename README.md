## **Gather My News**

this tool helps me to collect interesting articles from the platforms that I generally visit on the internet. I first implemented dev.to. in the future I have a plan to add more platforms into it.

### **Usage**

if you have docker and docker-compose just use it!

```
    docker-compose up --build
```

otherwise you can directly call the gather.py script after installing requirements. 

```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python gather.py
```

outputs can found under **data/** directory.
